1)  CHRISTA
Do you want to talk?
2)  
Let's stay focused.
3)  
Kenny was my friend.
4)  
I blame the fucker who took Clem.
5)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}I guess that's a no, then.
6)  OMID
He just lost two friends; it's pretty understandable, right?
7)  LEE
{Body-B}{SadA}Nothing to say; {AngryA}we need to stay focused on what we're doing.
8)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{NormalB}I know we can't just take a minute, {WorriedA}but... {SadA}you're not a machine.
9)  LEE
{Body-B}{SadA}Kenny was my friend.
10)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Soon as someone dies, they {WorriedA}don't immediately have to have their sins forgiven.
11)  LEE
He was what passes for a friend now.
12)  CHRISTA
{NormalB}I understand.
13)  LEE
{Body-B}{SadA}He could be tough to like, {NormalC}but I agreed with him most the time; {HappyA}so we were assholes together, {NormalD}I guess.
14)  LEE
That's two on him, now. The motherfucker who's got Clementine has Ben and Kenny to answer for.
15)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{WorriedA}Keep a clear head, Lee.
16)  LEE
We wouldn't be out here. {AngryB}We'd all been together to defend against Vernon {AngryC}and we'd be out on the water. {SadB}Everyone would be alive.
17)  CHRISTA
Look, Lee, this is a shitty time, but I want to clear something up.
18)  LEE
What is it? [determined, distracted]
19)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Clementine. {SadA}I know Kenny was your guy.
20)  LEE
{Body-B}{NormalB}Yeah. [what of it]
21)  CHRISTA
{AngryA}Well?
22)  
Ain't much choice, now.
23)  
Find her a family that's...capable.
24)  
You guys would be great for her.
61)  
You guys would be great for her.
25)  LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}Ain't much choice now.
26)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryB}No, there isn't.
27)  OMID
{Body-A}{SickA}Easy, Christa.
28)  CHRISTA
{AngryA}I don't care that he's who you wanted, {ThinkingA}but I want you to know that {WorriedA}you don't need to worry.
29)  LEE
{NormalD}Okay.
30)  LEE
{Body-B}{DisgustA}Just take care of her as long as you can, {AngryA}then find her a family that's capable.
247)  LEE
{Body-B}{DisgustA}Just take care of her as long as you can, {AngryA}then find her a family that's capable.
31)  OMID
{Body-A}{AngryA}We're capable.
250)  OMID
{Body-A}{AngryA}We're capable.
32)  LEE
{ThinkingA}You and your girlfriend might want different things.
249)  LEE
{ThinkingA}You and your girlfriend might want different things.
33)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}That's enough.
251)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}That's enough.
34)  LEE
{AngryA}Fine. {NormalC}But you heard me.
248)  LEE
{AngryA}Fine. {NormalC}But you heard me.
35)  CHRISTA
She'll be fine, Lee.
246)  CHRISTA
She'll be fine, Lee.
36)  LEE
{Body-B}{HappyA}You guys would be great for her. {ThinkingA}Keep her safe.
37)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{HappyA}We'd do our best, {ThinkingA}you know that.
38)  
Are you... okay?
39)  
What's going on with you?
40)  
Good. Thanks.
41)  LEE
{Body-B}{NormalD}Are you... {SadA}okay?
42)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{SadA}I should be asking you that.
43)  LEE
Before, in the attic.
44)  CHRISTA
{ThinkingA}It's nothing.
50)  CHRISTA
{ThinkingA}It's nothing.
45)  OMID
What's nothing?
51)  OMID
What's nothing?
46)  CHRISTA
{DisgustA}Let's just keep moving.
52)  CHRISTA
{DisgustA}Let's just keep moving.
47)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}What's going on with you?
48)  CHRISTA
I just saw your friends get killed.
49)  LEE
I mean before, back at the attic.
53)  LEE
{Body-B}{NormalB}Good. {HappyA}Thanks. Whatever your best is, {ThinkingA}I'll trust it.
54)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{HappyA}That's all you can do.
55)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Omid and I have to stay safe. For her.
56)  
Yeah, you do.
57)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Yeah, you do. {NormalC}Let me take all the risks.
58)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{WorriedA}That's not what I mean, {ThinkingA}necessarily.
59)  LEE
{AngryA}It's what I mean. {ThinkingA}It's what we gotta do.
60)  
Find her a family that's capable.
62)  CHRISTA
[frustrated] {Body-A}{AngryA}Just... {AngryB}fuck. You don't have to worry about anything, {AngryA}okay? {ThinkingA}Not that it seems like you are.
63)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}That's that, then.
64)  OMID
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Yeah, that's that, hon.
65)  CHRISTA
Fuck, be careful across here.
66)  OMID
River Street's just up ahead.
67)  OMID
[hushed] Whoa, careful.
68)  CHRISTA

Yeah, we don't need any more accidents.
81)  OMID

82)  LEE
It's okay.
83)  CHRISTA
He didn't mean to...
