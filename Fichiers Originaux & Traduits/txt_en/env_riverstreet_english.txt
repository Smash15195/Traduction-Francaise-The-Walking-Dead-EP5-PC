4)  
Let's stay focused.
5)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{NormalB}I know we can't just take a minute, {WorriedA}but... {SadA}you're not a machine.
6)  LEE
{Body-B}{SadA}Nothing to say; {AngryA}we need to stay focused on what we're doing.
7)  
Kenny was my friend.
8)  LEE
{Body-B}{SadA}Kenny was my friend.
9)  LEE
{Body-B}{SadA}He could be tough to like, {NormalC}but I agreed with him most the time; {HappyA}so we were assholes together, {NormalD}I guess.
10)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Soon as someone dies, they {WorriedA}don't immediately have to have their sins forgiven.
11)  CHRISTA
{NormalB}I understand.
12)  
I blame the fucker who took Clem.
13)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{WorriedA}Keep a clear head, Lee.
14)  LEE
We wouldn't be out here. {AngryB}We'd all been together to defend against Vernon {AngryC}and we'd be out on the water. {SadB}Everyone would be alive.
15)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}I guess that's a no, then.
16)  LEE
{Body-B}{SadA}Well, {AngryA}he gets an hour moritorium, {SadA}at least.
17)  LEE
{Body-B}{AngryC}The fucker who took Clem has Kenny to answer for, too.

38)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{HappyA}We'd do our best, {ThinkingA}you know that.
39)  
Are you... okay?
40)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{SadA}I should be asking you that.
41)  CHRISTA
{DisgustA}Let's just keep moving.
42)  CHRISTA
{ThinkingA}It's nothing.
43)  LEE

51)  
Yeah, you do.
52)  LEE
{AngryA}It's what I mean. {ThinkingA}It's what we gotta do.
53)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Yeah, you do. {NormalC}Let me take all the risks.
54)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{WorriedA}That's not what I mean, {ThinkingA}necessarily.
57)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}That's that, then.
58)  OMID
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Yeah, that's that, hon.
59)  CHRISTA
{WorriedA}When it comes to Clementine.
60)  LEE
{DisgustA}Kenny didn't die for "it's nothing."
61)  LEE
You {ThinkingA}know what I'm talking about.
62)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{WorriedA}I don't know what you mean.
63)  LEE
I mean, {SadA}you know why Kenny did that, right?
