{thinkingb} Do I not seem cool?
32)  
I only have this radio. [Lie]
33)  CAMPMAN
{normalb} You travel light. {normalc} I don't believe you.
34)  LEE
{normald} This is all I've got, okay?
35)  
I don't have anything. [Lie]
36)  LEE
{normald} I don't have anything on me.
37)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} Really. You got all the way here without any weapons?
38)  LEE
{thinkingb} Lost 'em.
39)  
Seriously.
40)  
Fine. Here.
49)  
Fine. Here.
41)  CAMPMAN
{normalc} Good. Go sit down.
42)  LEE
Okay, fine.
43)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} That's what I thought.
44)  CAMPMAN
{normalc} You shouldn't lie.
45)  CAMPMAN
Sit down.
46)  CAMPMAN
{sada} Just... SIT down. {normald} Please don't do anything stupid.
47)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} Do it. {normalc} Don't dick me around.
48)  
That's everything.

58)  LEE
{normald} Yeah. I know who you are.
59)  CAMPMAN
{normald} You saw my car out front, then.
60)  CAMPMAN
{normald} You wouldn't. [pause] {normalc} People like you don't.
61)  LEE
{normald} No. {normalc} I don't know anything about you.
62)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} Now you're thinking,  {thinkingb} "Who would have it out for me," huh?
63)  CAMPMAN
You see anything else you want in there? {sada} Not a whole lot left.
64)  LEE
{normald} I didn't take from you.
65)  CAMPMAN
{thinkingb} Your people didn't?
66)  LEE
{normald} I didn't agree with it.
67)  CAMPMAN
{normalc} That's what little Clementine said. {disgustb} Why didn't you?
68)  
She didn't want me to.
69)  
It wasn't right.
70)  
You were coming back.
71)  LEE
{normalb} She didn't want me to.
72)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} She didn't want you to do a lot of things.
73)  LEE
{normald} What do you want me to say?
80)  LEE
{normald} What do you want me to say?
74)  LEE
{normald} It wasn't right. It wasn't our stuff.
75)  CAMPMAN
{normalb} That's real good of you.
76)  LEE
{normalc} Look, what do you want me to say?
77)  LEE
{thinkinga} You were coming back. The dome light was on.
78)  CAMPMAN
{sada} We did come back.
79)  CAMPMAN
{normalc} I said we {crazya} DID COME BACK.
81)  CAMPMAN
{normald} If only the rest of your crew had been {normalc} so "magnanimous."
82)  CAMPMAN
{normald} I don't want you to say anything. {angryb} I want you to know what happened.
83)  LEE
{normald} Everything was just out there, for the taking. {normalc} We were starving. Do you--
84)  CAMPMAN
[snaps] {crazya} For the taking?! Do you know what you TOOK from me?!
85)  
I don't care.
86)  
Don't start on who took what!
87)  
I'm sorry. Whatever it is, I'm sorry.
88)  LEE
{normalc} I don't care.
89)  CAMPMAN
[pissed, fighting back tears] {angrya} Fuck you. {sada} You have {sadb} no idea.
90)  LEE
{normalc} Don't you start on who took what from who.
91)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} I didn't take her from you. I {angrya} rescued her from you. Don't you get that?
92)  LEE
{normald} I'm sorry. {sada} Whatever it is, whatever happened,  {normald} you have to hear that I am sorry.
93)  CAMPMAN
{normala} That doesn't mean anything to me. {normalb} I wish it did. {normalc} I'm not a bad man. I don't believe in vengeance, {normald} but I've got nothing left.
94)  CAMPMAN
[sadly to himself, he looks down] {angrya} You have no idea.... [sniff]
95)  CAMPMAN
My son, Adam, went missing. I took him out hunting even though my wife said he was too young. I figured he had to learn.
96)  CAMPMAN
I came back without him and the look on her face said... "You are a MONSTER."
97)  CAMPMAN
We all went out looking for him. We never found him. I hurt her so bad.
98)  CAMPMAN
{normald} Have you ever {sada} hurt somebody you care about?
99)  CAMPMAN
{disgustb} A few weeks back, there might have been a station wagon in the forest?
100)  CAMPMAN
{normalc} Full all sorts of food, water, {normald} things you need to survive.
101)  CAMPMAN
Yeah. I'm not some cannibal, Lee. Some killer out in the woods. Some v...villain. {sada} I'm just a... dad. I coach little league.
102)  CAMPMAN
{normald} [gathering himself]
104)  
Not on purpose.
106)  LEE
{normald} Yes. Of course.
107)  CAMPMAN
{sada} Who?
108)  CAMPMAN
{disgustb} If it were on purpose {thinkinga} you'd be a sociopath.
109)  LEE
{normald} Not on purpose.
110)  LEE
{normald} No.
134)  LEE
{normald} No.
111)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} That's not true.
112)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} What about your wife?
113)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} You didn't care about that woman before holding her back so your {thinkingb} friend could bash her dad's {normalc} brains in?
114)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} What about that boy who didn't make it out of...{thinkingb} Crawford, was it? If it didn't hurt him, {thinkinga} whatever you did hurt that girl in there.
115)  CAMPMAN
{normald} It's okay. {thinkinga} I know you have.
116)  CAMPMAN
I hurt her so bad.
117)  CAMPMAN
{normald} Then you {normalc} took all of our things. {angrya} You robbed us. {normald} I could've earned her trust back, Lee, {sada} but not after that.
118)  CAMPMAN
{normald} And then we came back and {angrya}all our stuff was gone. {angryb} Your people, Lee. That asshole in the ball cap. {crazya} His stupid fucking wife.
119)  CAMPMAN
{normald} I could've earned her trust back if they hadn't made our situation so desperate.
120)  
I'm sorry.
121)  
It's not my fault.
122)  
You fucked up.
123)  LEE
{sada} I'm sorry.
124)  LEE
{sada} It's not my fault.
125)  LEE
{sada}You {normalc}  fucked up.
126)  CAMPMAN
[a little choked up] {sada}They didn't get far... I... {sadd} found them a day later. In the road. [can't finish]
127)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} The hungrier we got the more she blamed me. {normald}  Until she finally took our daughter, Elizabeth, and left.
128)  CAMPMAN
Do I look like a monster to you?
131)  
We all do.
132)  LEE
{angrya} Yes.
133)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} If you think that now, {normalc} you just wait.
135)  LEE
{normalc}  We all do.
136)  CAMPMAN
[upset] {angrya} Some more than others.
137)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} I'm not like you.
138)  
I protected her in that place.
139)  
I did my best.
140)  LEE
{normald} I did what I had to.
141)  LEE
{normald} I did my best.
142)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} You killed a man with a pitchfork right in front of a little girl.[1]
143)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} You let that little girl get fed disgusting human meat.[1]
144)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} You walked a little girl into a dairy full of sick people and let them get their hands on her.[1]
145)  LEE
{normald} I was trying to find some place safe for her.
146)  
I was trying to find a safe place for her.
147)  
It's more complicated than that.
148)  
I would do it differently.
149)  LEE
{normald} It's more complicated than that.
150)  LEE
{normald} I would do differently if I could.
151)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} You abandoned a defenseless, grieving woman.[2]
152)  
She deserved it.
153)  
I had my reasons.
154)  
It was impossible to save him.
155)  
It was impossible to save her.
156)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} You lied to her about who you really are.[2]
157)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} You let a boy get yanked out a window and into the night so you could protect a pretty girl with a gun.[2]
158)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} You let a woman who knew who you really were die to protect your secret.[2]
159)  LEE
{angrya} She deserved it.
160)  LEE
{normald} It wasn't the right time to tell her.
161)  LEE
{normald} It was impossible to save him. {sada} To save them both.
162)  LEE
{normald} It was impossible to save her. {sada} To save them both.
163)  
I wouldn't do that again.
164)  LEE
{normald} I wouldn't do that again, either.
165)  LEE
{normald} I wouldn't do that again.
166)  
You weren't there.
167)  LEE
{angrya} You weren't there.
168)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} The sweatshirt she's wearing was my boy's. You stole that from us. [3]
169)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} You brought her to the most dangerous place in this city where she could've died.[3]
170)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} How many times did she almost die with you?
171)  
We were starving. It was cold.
172)  
I couldn't leave her alone.
173)  
You wouldn't have done better.
174)  
That's not the whole story.
175)  
I fucked up.
176)  CAMPMAN
[outburst] {crazya} SO MY FAMILY STARVED, IN THE COLD.
177)  LEE
{normald} We were starving. It was cold.
178)  CAMPMAN
[explodes] SHE WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER OFF.
179)  CAMPMAN
[explodes] THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE.
180)  LEE
{normald} You {normalc} wouldn't have done better.
181)  LEE
{normald} That's {normalc} not the whole story.
182)  CAMPMAN
THE WHOLE STORY?!?
183)  LEE
{normald} I fucked up.
184)  CAMPMAN
[snarls] Yes, you did.
185)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} Look at you. [snarls]
186)  CAMPMAN
You're a monster.[refrain on monster] You're a murderer and a thief and I'm going to hurt you so bad.
187)  
Clementine.
188)  
Ben.
189)  
Carley.
190)  
Lilly.
191)  
My wife.
192)  LEE
{normald} Clementine. {thinkinga} The girl misses her parents. {sada} I'm not them.
193)  LEE
{normald} A boy named Ben who was with us. {sada} I liked him;  he was a good kid.
194)  LEE
{normald} Her name was Carley. She was killed. {sada} Don't feel like I did enough to protect her. {normald} Maybe I couldn't. {thinkinga} I don't know.
195)  
Kenny.
196)  LEE
{normald} A guy named Kenny.
197)  LEE
{normald} A woman named Lilly.The first few months with her were good. She just wanted to keep her {sada} dad safe and... [sigh] {sadb} I wasn't really there for her when she needed me.
198)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} Clementine said she wasn't with you.
199)  CAMPMAN
{normalb} How?
200)  LEE
{sada} My wife.
201)  LEE
{sadb} I hurt her a long time ago.
202)  
It doens't matter.
203)  
In a lot of ways.
204)  LEE
{normald} It doesn't matter.
205)  CAMPMAN
{thinkinga} If you say so.
206)  LEE
{normald} In a lot of ways.
207)  LEE
[deciding to finally say what happened] She travelled for work. {thinkingb} I didn't like that. {sadb} I wanted a family.
208)  LEE
[quiet, tense] How about you?
209)  LEE
{normalc} I got sick one day on my way to class. Cancelled it and went home. {normald} Found her there with someone else. [long pause] {sadc} Killed him. [takes a deep breath]
210)  CAMPMAN
{normald} A reasonable thing to want.
211)  LEE
{normald} So we fought. {sadc} And it made my biggest fear come true.
212)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} [hmmph. typical]
214)  
I didn't steal from you!
215)  
I'm SORRY!
216)  
Just give me Clementine back.
217)  
It doesn't have to be this way.
218)  LEE
{normalc} I DIDN'T steal from you!
219)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} But think of everything {angryb} else you did.
220)  LEE
{normald} I'm {sada} SORRY.
221)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} I hear that. [firm]
222)  LEE
{normald} Just give me Clementine back.
223)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} I'd rather kill her myself. Because {angryb} that's what will happen if she goes with you.
224)  LEE
{normald} It doesn't have to be this way.
225)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} You can't take care of anyone.
226)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} You came here for Clementine and I don't even know why.
227)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} After I heard Clementine on the radio and{normalc} realized who you folks were, {angrya}I came after you purely for revenge.
228)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} After I found Clementine on my radio {normalc} I wasn't even mad at you. {angrya} I was coming for the others. For revenge.
229)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} Lee, listen to me. I need you to hear this before what happens next. {normalc} I can take care of her. We can have a family.
230)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} But the more I heard about the things you did and the danger she was in... {crazya} our plan changed.
231)  CAMPMAN
{normalc} I know how to be a dad, you know. She wouldn't be exposed to what she has been with you.
232)  
You're crazy.
233)  
I got bitten. Okay.
235)  CAMPMAN
{Angrya} Keeping her with you is crazy.
236)  LEE
{normalc} That's not happening. {angrya} You're crazy.
237)  CAMPMAN
{fearb} You were what?
238)  LEE
Yeah. {sadb} I probably don't have a whole lot of time.
239)  LEE
{normald} Look... {sada} I was bitten.
240)  CAMPMAN
[wind knocked out of him] {normald} Wow. Okay, then.
241)  LEE
{angrya} No. Shut up.
242)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} It makes sense.
243)  LEE
{angrya} It's not happening.
244)  CAMPMAN
{normalb} All right. {thinkinga} I expected you to put up a fight.
245)  
You'll take care of her?
246)  
No. You can't have her.
247)  
I'm sorry, again.
248)  
You'll have to kill me.
249)  
I'm bitten and you're going to be too.
250)  
Let us go.
251)  LEE
{thinkinga} Why are you saying "we?"
252)  CAMPMAN
{normald} We'll give her a home.
253)  LEE
{normald} You'll take care of her?
254)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} Lee...
255)  LEE
{angrya} No, you're not taking her.
256)  LEE
{angrya} I said no.
257)  CAMPMAN
I'm glad this didn't have to get violent.
260)  CAMPMAN
I'm glad this didn't have to get violent.
258)  LEE
{normald} I'm sorry, again, {sada} for your family.
259)  CAMPMAN
{normald} Me, too.
261)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} Yeah, I know. ["you'll have to kill me]
262)  LEE
{angrya} You'll have to {angryc} kill me.
263)  LEE
{angryb} Make sure you shoot me in the head.
264)  LEE
{normald} I'm bitten.
265)  LEE
{normalc} I got bit and I'm going to make sure {Angrya} you end up the same way as me.
266)  CAMPMAN
[shocked] I...
267)  CAMPMAN
[recomposes himself] {normalb} No. I'll be with her and {thinkinga} you'll be rotting in the streets.
268)  CAMPMAN
{fearb} What? [surprised]
269)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} No, no, I don't think so.
270)  LEE
{angrya} Let us go.
271)  CAMPMAN
You're going away and {thinkinga} we're starting a new family.
273)  CAMPMAN
You're going away and {thinkinga} we're starting a new family.
272)  CAMPMAN
{angrya} This is happening.
274)  CAMPMAN
{normald} Hey, honey. I think this is all going to work out.
275)  CAMPMAN
I'm glad, too.
276)  LEE
{thinkinga} What-- [something catches his eye]
277)  LEE
{normald} I couldn't leave her at the house, alone.
278)  CAMPMAN
[To Lee] {thinkinga} Isn't it?
279)  LEE
[uh...] {normalc} Just about.
280)  CAMPMAN

281)  CAMPMAN
[to the bag] {normald} I miss you {sada} so much, Tess. {happya} You're going to like Clementine a lot, though. {normald} She's not Lizzy, but she's {happya} sweet. {normalb} She wouldn't hurt a fly. [last part delievered to lee]
