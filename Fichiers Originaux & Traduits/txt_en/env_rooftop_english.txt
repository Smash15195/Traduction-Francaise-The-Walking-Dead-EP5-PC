{fearA} It's the only way!
558)  KENNY
[yelling across the gap] Just one big leap!
559)  KENNY
[yelling across the gap] You got it, Lee!
560)  KENNY
[yelling across the gap] JUMP!
561)  KENNY
[yelling across the gap] What are you waiting for?!
562)  KENNY
[yelling across the gap] You gotta do this, pal!
563)  OMID
[yelling across a gap] You can do it!
569)  BEN
[yelling across a gap] You can do it!
564)  OMID
[yelling across a gap] Don't look down!
565)  OMID
[yelling across a gap] Just jump!
566)  OMID
[yelling across a gap] You're psyching yourself out!
567)  OMID
[yelling across a gap]  We gotta go! Jump!
568)  BEN
[yelling across a gap] It's, uh, not that far!
570)  BEN
[yelling across a gap] I believe in you!
571)  BEN
[yelling across a gap] Hurry!
572)  BEN
[yelling across a gap] One, two, THREE!
573)  LEE
{normalb}See anything?
658)  LEE
{normalb}See anything?
574)  BEN
{thinkinga}There's a fire escape here; {sada}that's about it.
575)  LEE
{normalc}Hey, Ben.
576)  
You came with me.
577)  
You still want to die?
578)  BEN
{sada}I'm more {sadb}afraid of getting someone else killed.
579)  LEE
{angrya}You still want to die?
580)  BEN
{feara}I'm still afraid of getting eaten; more than ever.
581)  LEE
{sada}Well, you're here. {angrya}Don't get ME killed.
582)  
You're here. Don't get me killed.
583)  LEE
{normalb}Are you afraid?
584)  BEN
{sada}I won't.
585)  
If it ends up being you and Clem...
586)  BEN
{angrya}Don't talk like that.
587)  LEE
{sadb}The way things have been going, {angrya}I don't have any choice, Ben.
588)  LEE
{angrya}When it all comes down to it, if it's just you and Clementine for some reason, {sada}I think you'll have plenty of reason to want to live.
589)  
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.
590)  BEN
{fearb}Really...?
591)  LEE
{happya}Getting bitten's not that bad.
592)  LEE
{normalc}I'll make sure that doesn't happen, as well as I can.
593)  BEN
{sada}Thanks... {sadb}including me?
594)  LEE
{angrya}No. It's a death sentence. {sadb}It's horrible. {angrya}But try not to worry about it.
595)  BEN
{sada}...I don't think anything could change that.
596)  LEE
{thinkinga}You came with me.
597)  BEN
{sada}You didn't think I would?
598)  BEN
{normala}It's like you said, {happya}Clementine has been my biggest... {sadb}well... only real fan. {angrya}I'd be a big piece of crap if I didn't.
599)  BEN
{sada}Just, with {thinkinga}all we've been through, {sadb}it seemed like the only reasonable thing to do.
600)  LEE
{thinkinga}If we get over to that bell tower {happya}we might have some impact on all those walkers out there.
601)  BEN
{fearb}But then we just run through the streets? {sada}I dunno...
602)  LEE
{angrya}If we use that bell tower to lure all the walkers towards that side of the hospital, {happya}the road to the mansion and River Street shouldn't be too bad.
603)  BEN
{sada}Yeah, okay... {angrya}but you still have to get over there.
604)  BEN
{fearb}I think I'm staring down at my worst nightmare. {disgusta}Just a dusty haze of death.
605)  LEE
{thinkinga}What do you think?
606)  LEE
{angrya}Try to keep your shit together. We need to get off of this roof.
607)  LEE
Anything over here?
608)  CHRISTA
{sada}Honestly, my vision isn't great. {angrya}I think it's allergies or all that {disgusta}shit those walkers are kicking up.
609)  LEE
{sada}Hey.
635)  LEE
{sada}Hey.
610)  
Allergies. That's funny.
611)  LEE
{normalb}There's a bell tower over there.
612)  CHRISTA
{feara}You think you could pull all those bastards this way?
613)  LEE
{angrya}Hopefully, yeah. {thinkinga}Maybe clear out the other way.
614)  LEE
{normalb}The mansion's that way.
615)  LEE
{angrya}If we can use that bell tower to bring them to that side of the hospital, {sada}it won't be an easy trip back towards River Street, {happya}but it wouldn't be impossible.
616)  CHRISTA
{happya}I'm with you. {worrieda}Just have to get over there.
617)  CHRISTA
{normalb}Yeah.
618)  LEE
{sada}I know. It's this deal with Clem... it's everything; {angrya}it's put this rage inside me {angryb}like I can't even say.
619)  LEE
{surpriseb}I used to get allergies too. {normalb}And just... {thinkinga}fuck. Who was that guy?
620)  CHRISTA
{worrieda}Someone with priorities?
621)  LEE
{sada}Allergies... shit. People used to get those.
622)  CHRISTA
{happya}I know, right. {worrieda}You never see anybody in an end of the world story with hayfever.
623)  CHRISTA
{happya}It's not the time to get wistful. [she doesn't meant it]
624)  
I was worried you wouldn't come with me.
625)  LEE
{thinkinga}I was thinking you and Omid wouldn't come with me.
626)  LEE
{happya}Well, I appreciate it.
724)  LEE
{happya}Well, I appreciate it.
627)  LEE
{happyb}You two have been solid since day one.
722)  LEE
{happyb}You two have been solid since day one.
628)  CHRISTA
{sada}We look out for each other, {angrya}but we sure as hell weren't gonna let you go alone, {worrieda}not with that time bomb chewed into your wrist.
629)  CHRISTA
{happya}What is this, day three? Four?
723)  CHRISTA
{happya}What is this, day three? Four?
630)  CHRISTA
{worrieda}You guys have taken care of us; we take care of you.
631)  LEE
{happya}I appreciate it.
632)  LEE
{normalb}What's up over here?
633)  OMID
{happya}Bell tower. That's what's up.
634)  LEE
{surpriseb}Huh. {happya}Yeah. That could help.
636)  
I think you're Clem's favorite.
637)  OMID
{angryb}When we get this fucker, we'll get out of sight and leave you with him.
638)  OMID
You get me?
639)  LEE
{happya}Yeah, she's a big fan. {thinkinga}You get away with shit I never would.
640)  LEE
{happya}I get you.
641)  OMID
{angrya}We're getting her back, Lee. You know that, right?
642)  LEE
{happyb}I think you're Clem's favorite, you know that?
643)  LEE
{angrya}Yeah.
644)  OMID
{happyb}Really?
645)  
I'll see if we can make it to that bell tower.
646)  
How's the leg?
647)  LEE
{happya}Thanks.
648)  LEE
{angrya}I'll see if we can make it out to that bell tower.
649)  OMID
{sada}Okay, be careful though; I don't want you going any sooner than you have to.
650)  LEE
{sada}How's the leg?
651)  OMID
{happya}Yeah.
652)  LEE
{happya}She's something, right?
653)  OMID
{happya}It's good. {angrya}Wouldn't mean shit if you hadn't left Clementine with me when you went in to Crawford. {sadb}That little girl saved my life.
654)  OMID
{happya}Yeah. {sada}Don't worry more than you should about her, okay?
655)  OMID
{happya}It's doing a lot better. Thanks for going into Crawford for me, {sada}even if it wasn't entirely FOR me. {happyb}Clementine too. {angrya}She's tough as hell.
656)  LEE
{sada}Isn't she?
657)  KENNY
{sada}Nah. {angrya}I'm just, uh, {sada}taking a minute, actually. {sadb}I'm sorry; I know I shouldn't.
659)  LEE
{happya}Hey, Ken.
660)  
What's going on?
661)  KENNY
{sada}Just... everything. {angryb}Ah, fuck man. {sadc}You know.
662)  LEE
{thinkinga}What's going on?
663)  LEE
{sada}I do.
664)  KENNY
{sada}I can't thank you enough for what you did for Duck. {sadb}I don't know how I'd be if you hadn't--
665)  LEE
{sada}Don't dwell on it.
666)  LEE
{sadb}Ken--
667)  KENNY
[pulls out of it]{angrya} No. I'm sorry. We're in a fucking hurry to get off this roof; it's not the time. {sada}I'm sorry. {angrya}I'm okay.
668)  KENNY
{feara}I look at where we are, right now, {angryb}and I can't imagine {sadb}Kat and Duck in all this mess.
669)  KENNY
{sada}I'm... glad I was on the one who did it. I can tell myself, forever, that I saved him from the worst of it.
670)  LEE
{normalb}Yeah, could be part of how we get through the streets.
671)  LEE
{thinkinga}There's bell tower over there.
672)  KENNY
{normalb}We know what those do.
673)  KENNY
{surpriseda}Yeah.
674)  KENNY
{happya}I can do that, yeah.
675)  LEE
{normalb}The mansion's that way; {normalc}the bell tower's over there; if we go down the opposite side of the roof, {happya}we might be able to make it without too much trouble.
676)  LEE
{sada}Any thoughts about... anything else?
677)  KENNY
{sada}Nah, I'm all right. Just needed to take a second. {angrya}I'll keep an eye out over here. {happya}Sorry.
678)  
How many you think are below us?
679)  LEE
{sada}Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
680)  LEE
{feara}How many you think are wandering around underneath us right now?
681)  KENNY
{feara}And out there? {sada}Look at that dust. {angrya}Fuck, man, who knows?
682)  KENNY
{surpriseda}In the hospital? Thousands. {thinkinga}Who knows? It was full of dead before, right?
