{fearB}Where the hell did they go?
624)  KENNY
{angryA}Well, Clementine isn't with them, so fuck 'em.
625)  LEE
[with growing frustration] {thinkingB}Couldn't they have left ANYTHING useful?!
626)  LEE
[slightly frustrated, mild projection]{thinkingB}This led to the stairs...[Although the exit is welded shut, It's actually a good thing]{fearA} Looks like it's flooded with walkers up there.
627)  CHRISTA
[commenting on the stairwell entrance being welded shut][slight Projection]{angryA}Guess it's a good thing they're sealed up then.
628)  KENNY
[commenting on the stairwell entrance being welded shut][Slight Projection]{FearA}Vernon's group's got the place sealed up pretty tight.
629)  LEE
[looking at a door thats been welded shut]{thinkingB}Not gettin' out that way.
630)  LEE
[looking at the door to the sewers, zombies are behind it]{angryA}Can't those things let up for a fucking minute?!
631)  BEN
{thinkingA}That door should hold 'em back for a while, {fearA}but we've gotta get out of here soon.

633)  KENNY
[responding to Lee saying : Can't those things let up for a fucking minute?!]{angryA}Just keep looking for another way out.  I got this.
634)  LEE
{thinkingB}That door's not gonna last forever.
635)  LEE
[After Elevator][to himself -looking at a hanging scale]{thinkingB}I don't think I can pry open the doors with this.
636)  KENNY
[frustrated]{angryA}Shit, this is a morgue!  {thinkingA}There's gotta be SOMETHING in here we can use!
637)  LEE
[to Himself- looking at a hanging scale]{normalD}This isn't gonna help.

655)  LEE
{thinkingB}Whatever happens,{fearA} don't let anything through that door; {normalD}got it?
656)  BEN
[without conviction, not believeing in himself very much]{fearB}I got it.
657)  LEE
[stern]{angryA}Ben, I'm serious. {angryA}Clementine is out there and I NEED to get to her.  {fearA}Don't. Fuck. Up.
658)  BEN

666)  LEE
[frustrated] {thinkingB}Just... watch that door.
667)  KENNY
[sincere, but without a lot of emotion]{happyA}It's been me and you, pal, since the very beginning.
668)  KENNY
[getting back to business, not wanting to have this discussion]{happyA}Hey, Clementine needs you.  Get back to it.
669)  LEE
{happyA}Hey, thanks for having my back.

{thinkingA}Yeah, we just have to get the hell out of here.
683)  CHRISTA
{sadA}You okay, Lee?
684)  LEE
{thinkingB}I think we can get out through the elevator shaft, {fearA}but the doors are stuck shut!
685)  KENNY
{thinkingA}Well, there's gotta be SOMETHING around here you can pry 'em open with!  {angryA}Look around!
686)  CHRISTA
{angryA}Well, do it then.  This door won't hold forever.
687)  LEE
