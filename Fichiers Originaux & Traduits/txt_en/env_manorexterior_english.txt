93)  BEN
{disgustA}I never made it home. They could be {fearB}alive or {sadE}dead or {sadC}walkers or {surprisedA}WORSE and {angryB}I DON'T KNOW. SO {angryC}GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK.

{thinkingA}At least Lee's thinking. You're {angryA}goddamn right we get another boat.
122)  OMID
{disgustA}Aren't we all missing the {fearA}point right now? Clementine is the {angryA}goal. That's it.
123)  CHRISTA
{angryA}But not here.
124)  KENNY
{angryA}This is bullshit; he {fearB}might not even be around, so -- {sadA}with all due respect, Lee -- his {thinkingA}opinion doesn't carry a lot of weight.
125)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}Look, we know what Lee thinks.
126)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}[to Lee, closer] Get out of town at {disgustA}least, right?

152)  LEE
{disgustB}I'm fine; what's {normalC}done is done. We {thinkingB}have to focus on finding Clementine.
153)  LEE
{thinkingB}It comes in waves. I {fearA}took a couple spills {normalD}getting back here, so keep an eye on me.
