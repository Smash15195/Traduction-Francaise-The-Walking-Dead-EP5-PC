{thinkingA}This place seems pretty sealed off.
14)  BEN
[smelling] {fearA}Ugh.
15)  KENNY
{angryA}Everyone keep a goddamn eye out.
16)  KENNY
[overwhelmed] {fearB}God... [gathinger himself] [sigh]
17)  CHRISTA
{sadA}Well. [looking at suicidal couple]
18)  
Might've been the right choice...
19)  
Let's keep moving.
20)  
How could they do this...
21)  LEE
Smart. Think of all the people we've seen go... they got to do it their own way. Together.
22)  KENNY
[quiet, to himself] {thinkingA}Got at least one shot left.
23)  LEE
{normalD}Let's keep moving. We gotta go.
24)  CHRISTA
[distant] Yeah. [a pause] {sadA}We've seen so many people... {sadB}I don't know why these ones break my heart.
25)  OMID
We should move.
26)  CHRISTA
[distant] {fearA}Yeah.
27)  KENNY
{thinkingA}Looks like we can stay off the streets all the way to River Street if we're careful.
28)  CHRISTA
{happyB}Let's go.
29)  BEN
Go ahead.
30)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}Let's clear the room before we move on. {normalB}Lee, figure out where we're headed.
31)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}Nothing other than personal items in here.
32)  LEE
{thinkingA}Might be the way out.
33)  LEE
{thinkingA}This house is overrun, too.
34)  LEE
[to the group, not too loud] {fearA}House is full, too. Stay quiet.
35)  LEE
{fearA}The streets are full. {thinkingA}Hundreds of them.
36)  LEE
{fearA}We're not going out this window.
37)  OMID
It's sick, but... think of all the pain they avoided.
38)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}I guess Crawford would've gotten them, anyway.
39)  KENNY
[pickup1][preempting Lee] Don't ask me how I'm doing -- let's just keep going.
40)  LEE
{sadA}You still with us, Ben?
41)  BEN
Yeah, Lee. I just want to help.
42)  KENNY
[helping lee over] Here you go.
43)  LEE
Thanks.
44)  CHRISTA
Let's keep going. Be careful up here.
45)  OMID
They haven't learned to climb yet, right?
46)  LEE
Ben!
47)  BEN
[hitting the ground] UGHAHHH!
48)  BEN
[falling, surprised] Wa-AHHH!
49)  OMID
Holy fuck! [to the group]What are we gonna do?!
50)  CHRISTA
Be care--
51)  CHRISTA
Shit.
52)  BEN
[wrecked, in shock] Oww...uh... I'm okay....[a little too loud]
53)  
Shh!
54)  
Are you okay?!
63)  LEE
Are you okay?!
55)  
God dammit, Ben...
65)  LEE
God dammit, Ben...
56)  LEE
Shh! QUIET, Ben, or they'll be on top of us.
57)  BEN
[wrecked, in shock] I'm okay, just get me out of here...
58)  BEN
[wrecked, in shock] I just slipp--OWWW!
59)  KENNY
[grumbling] How the fuck did this happen?
60)  BEN
[wrecked, in shock] Please, just get me up!
61)  KENNY
Yeah, try to keep your mouth shut! [shh]
62)  BEN
[wrecked, in shock] I'm sorry, just get me up... my leg's hurt, I think.
64)  KENNY
What the fuck happened, Ben?
66)  BEN
[wrecked, in shock] I'm sor-sorry, I'm sorry.
67)  KENNY
Just don't panic.
68)  KENNY
We're gonna get your ass up.
69)  BEN
[wrecked, in shock] Really? I thought you --
70)  KENNY
Fucking hell...
71)  BEN
[wrecked, in shock] What is it? I'm okay... I'm okay....
72)  KENNY
We can get you up. We can...
73)  BEN
[being moved] OWWWW!!! UGHH...
74)  
He's screwed.
77)  LEE
He's screwed.
75)  
Yank him off.
78)  KENNY
He's NOT screwed. He can't die down here.
79)  LEE
What do you want to do, Ken? We can't--
80)  LEE
Just yank him off that thing. Fast, like a Band-Aid.
81)  BEN
WHAT?!
82)  KENNY
Do you think--
83)  
He can stay quiet.
84)  
If he'd be quiet, MAYBE.
85)  LEE
He's quiet. We can take our time and save his life.
86)  BEN
[panicked, wounded] I can be super qui--
87)  LEE
IF he'd be quiet, then MAYBE, but Kenny, this is fucking serious. He could die just by moving him wrong.
88)  BEN
[panicked, injured] I won't move!
89)  KENNY
BEN!
90)  BEN
[injured] Please!
91)  KENNY
Well, we gotta do something!
92)  BEN
OH GOD DON'T LET THEM GET TO ME!
93)  KENNY
FUCK!
94)  KENNY
Do you have any bullets left?! This has only got one left in it.
95)  LEE
I'm out!
96)  KENNY
Shit!

What are you gonna do?
98)  KENNY
GIVE THEM TO ME AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

103)  KENNY
Get the fuck out of here.
104)  LEE

105)  KENNY
GO BACK. She needs you, Lee!
106)  KENNY
Give it to me.
107)  KENNY
Fuck, that's not enough.
108)  LEE
Just one!
109)  KENNY
You're not doing shit! YOU are going after Clem!
110)  LEE
KENNY!
111)  LEE
What? We gotta do something!
112)  KENNY
THIS IS NOT A DISCUSSION.
113)  LEE
Okay, here!
114)  KENNY
Get back up there!
115)  KENNY
NOW!
116)  LEE
Okay, I'm going!
117)  KENNY
GOOD.
118)  
What are you gonna do?!?
121)  LEE

119)  
This is suicide!
120)  
LEAVE HIM, KEN!
122)  LEE
This is suicide, Kenny! You can't do this!

138)  CHRISTA
What happened?!?
139)  
They're gone.
140)  
I tried to help.
141)  
I couldn't do anything.
142)  LEE
[kenny has been killed along with Ben] God...DAMN...[catching his breath] God.
143)  OMID
...They're gone.
144)  LEE
They're gone. [kenny and ben eaten]
145)  LEE
[kenny ben killed] I... I tried to help.
146)  LEE
There just... there were too many of them. Ben was really messed up...[sigh] I don't know. There's nothing else.
147)  CHRISTA
What the fuck happened?!
148)  CHRISTA
I heard a shot.
149)  LEE
I couldn't do anything. Ben was really... messed up. Kenny couldn't leave him. [deep breath] It was just fucked.
150)  CHRISTA
I heard a couple shots...
151)  OMID
[floored] Wha--
255)  OMID
[floored] Wha--
152)  LEE
It was Ben's... biggest fear, you know?
253)  LEE
It was Ben's... biggest fear, you know?
153)  LEE
Kenny made sure... that Ben didn't feel any more pain than he had to.
256)  LEE
Kenny made sure... that Ben didn't feel any more pain than he had to.
154)  
Kenny took Ben out.
155)  
Kenny spared Ben, then himself.
156)  
He was fighting them off.
157)  
We needed more bullets.
160)  LEE
We needed more bullets.
158)  LEE
He was fighting them off... trying to, at least. It...[trails off] [sigh]
159)  CHRISTA
You needed a miracle. It's not your fault Lee.
161)  OMID
I can't believe...
162)  
Balcony
163)  LEE
[pickup1]Yeah. [I'm okay, just sad about the dead people]
164)  CHRISTA
[pickup1][seeing lee staring at the dead couple]Lee?  You okay?
165)  CHRISTA
[pickup1]Let's keep at it.
166)  LEE
[pickup1][looking at the dead couple.  Nothing left to say] [Sighs]
167)  CHRISTA
[pickup1]Hey, my parents' house looked a lot like this, and they watched kung fu movies.
168)  OMID
[pickup1]Judging by the decor of this room, I'd guess they were PBS watchers.
169)  CHRISTA
[pickup1]Just sayin'. [don't judge]
170)  LEE
[pickup1][looking at a painting][to himself] Hard to believe the world once felt this peaceful.
171)  KENNY
[pickup1] Don't you say that.
172)  KENNY
[pickup1] You stick it out as long as you can. You do whatever you have to. [a beat] I could've done more.
173)  
You did everything you could.
185)  
You did everything you could.
174)  
We all could've done more.
175)  
There's no use dwelling on it.
176)  LEE
[pickup1] You did everything you could.
187)  LEE
[pickup1] You did everything you could.
177)  LEE
[pickup1] We all could've done more. Myself included.
178)  LEE
[pickup1] There's no use dwelling on it. You know that.
190)  LEE
[pickup1] There's no use dwelling on it. You know that.
179)  KENNY
[pickup1] I could've been a better husband... a better father... could've been a better friend.  So let's figure a way outta here, get that little girl.
180)  KENNY

182)  CHRISTA
[pickup1] Yeah. [a pause] {sadA}We've seen so many people.... {sadB}I don't know why these two break my heart.
183)  KENNY
[pickup1] What's heartbreakin' is not givin' yourself a chance.
184)  KENNY
[pickup1] It's what Katjaa did.
195)  KENNY
[pickup1] It's what Katjaa did.
188)  
There's no use dwelling on the past.
191)  
I'm sorry, Ken.
192)  LEE
[pickup1] Jesus... I'm sorry, Ken.
193)  KENNY
[pickup1] She left me... my son... people that cared about us....  I forgive her, but it don't make it any less wrong.  You don't just end it cause it's hard.  You stick it out, and you help the folks you care about.  [beat] So let's figure a way outta here and get that little girl.
194)  LEE
[pickup1] How could they do this?
196)  LEE
[pickup1][looking at some wall art]What do you call this thing?
197)  OMID
[pickup1] ["what do you call this thing?"]Art?
198)  KENNY
[pickup1]["what do you call this thing?"]An eyesore.
199)  KENNY
[pickup1]Me and my fuckin' mouth....
200)  
Kenny and I've got this.
201)  
Someone's gotta stay back. In case.
202)  
Keep a lookout.
203)  LEE
[pickup1]And if all this goes bad, you might be Clementine's last hope.
210)  LEE
[pickup1]And if all this goes bad, you might be Clementine's last hope.
204)  CHRISTA
[pickup1][begrudingly] We'll keep an eye out.
211)  CHRISTA

205)  LEE
[pickup1]	Kenny and I can handle this.
206)  LEE
[pickup1]Even more reason we all don't need to risk it.  You worry about her.
207)  OMID
[pickup1]	Dude, let me help you; you're already hurt.
208)  LEE
[pickup1] Someone's gotta stay back. In case.

216)  LEE
[pickup1] Stay up here.  Keep an eye out.
219)  OMID
[pickup1][frustrated] We'll let you know if we see trouble.

[pickup1] I'm sorry, Lee.
242)  
He did what he had to.
243)  
Well, maybe he got away.
244)  
He wasn't a bad guy.
245)  LEE
[pickup1] He did what he had to. All the way to the end.
246)  LEE
[pickup1][reconsidering] Well, maybe he DID get away. I don't know. [solemn]
247)  LEE
[pickup1] He wasn't a bad guy. A lot of folks might not have always agreed. Maybe even me.
248)  LEE
[pickup1] [solemn] Right behind you.
249)  CHRISTA
[pickup1] We should go.
250)  BEN
